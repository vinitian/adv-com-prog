# Midterm
there are 6 six questions on the paper (~30 min for each question)
1. converting a python class into java
2. encapsulation : private/public/protected
3. open-closed principle (OCP) : open for inheritance, closed for modifications
    - subclass override the method of the parent class
    - call super()
4. polymorphism
    - super class, subclass, etc.
5. design pat terns
    - statis strategy vs. dynamic strategy
6. ArrayList<>

- midterm is easier than lab
- no page limit for things to bring into the exam room



# QnA
- how to make the click or Y/N questions on the terminal? is it possible using java? esp the click one (Y/N may use Scanner kb?)
- what if we write the constructor *after* the other methods?
    - it doesn't matter, because java compiles the whole thing (into .class in the bin folder) before executing the code
- there can be _**multiple constructors**_. e.g. one without parameters and one with parameters.
